    "\n",
    "In this part, we will work with five traces of real accelerometer data, collected from Pixel 3 phone, to implement a simple step counting algorithm we talked about during class. The key goal is to give you some practices of working with sensor data, applying denosing methods, and extracting useful information. There are a total of four tasks, each with its own deliverables as specified below. At the end of this assignment, you will complete a simple step detection algorithm. Part of the learning is to understand the impact of the parameters on the information extraction efficiency, so try to play around with key parameters to get the step detection results as close as possible to the ground truth. \n",

A Butterworth filter is a popular frequency domain lowpass filter that can remove high frequency noise while only letting the low frequencies through. In this task, we will use the Butterworth filter to construct a bandpass filter to only let through walking signal between 0.5Hz to 5Hz. We provide a code snippet for this filter below which you are free to use. \n",

As you increase the smoothing window, the signal will look cleaner and more visually pleasing, but beware of using too large a window since you will smooth out the important characteristics of the signal (for example, steps if you want to do step detection). Try increasing window size and see the effect.\n",
