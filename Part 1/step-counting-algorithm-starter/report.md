## Task 1
### Question 1
The ranges for D1 and D3, separated by  are as follows
D1 ranges:
x: 4.132 (max: 1.889, min: -2.243)
y: 4.615 (max: 5.471, min: 0.856)
z: 6.353 (max: 12.371, min: 6.018)

D3 ranges:
x: 3.361 (max: 2.063, min: -1.298)
y: 4.028 (max: 1.339, min: -2.689)
z: 5.585 (max: 3.084, min: -2.501)


### Question 2
The raw accelerometer data data reading looks different because the D1 data 
includes gravitational acceleration. The difference in value of the x, y,
and z plots are all dependant on how the phone is oriented relative to
gravity. This is different for the D3 data, as the sensor subtracts the 
gravity, so the values are all centered around 0.
